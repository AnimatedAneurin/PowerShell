# TestNet-Connection - SoftEther

## PRE-REQUISITES

Must have SoftEther Client installed on the device.
Recommended Operating System is Windows.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

To use this script, you will need all the files in this folder. The **"SoftEther Client Launcher.xml"** file is optional.

First download all required files and place them in **"C:\Program Files\SoftEther VPN Client\WIT\"** - This is the default directory that this script uses, you can change this later.

Once downloaded, Launch Task Scheduler as admin and import **"Test_NetConnection.xml"** - Don't need to change anything here if using everything as default.

A shortcut of your chosen VPN Connection will need to be created in the same directory of the script, as well as a config file.
This can be done by opening the SoftEther client, right click the VPN Connection and click on **"Create VPN Connection shortcut"**. As for the config file, same exact steps but instead of create shortcut, you click **"Export VPN Connection Setting"**

If using the default settings in the script, before you create the shortcut and config file make sure your VPN Connection is named **WealesIT**
